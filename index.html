<h2>Yahtzee</h2>
The <b>yahtzee</b> (also spelled <b>yatzee</b> , <b>yatzy</b> ) or <b>yam's</b> is a traditional board game of random reasoning you can also play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee"><b>yahtzee</b></a> online . The goal of the game is to combine the combinations with five dice to win a maximum of points.
<h2>Yahtzee History</h2>
Yam's, or "Yahtzee", was born in Canada in 1954. Its origin is linked to the story of a couple who, to spend time on their yacht, made their visitors discover a game of dice, they invented the "Yacht Game". This exciting table game was so popular with the guests that the couple asked Edwin S. Lowe to produce samples so that they could distribute them to their friends. And when he discovers the game, he falls under the charm and decides to buy the copyright by giving the inventors 1,000 games. That is why, two years later, the family game "Yacht Game" changed its name to officially the "Yahtzee".

In 1973, Milton Bradley (MB), a Hasbro firm, bought the ES Lowe Company and thereby acquired the rights of Yahtzee. Since then, the game that was born in the small circle of friends on a yacht, has known millions of followers around the world, rolling dice to have fun alone or in groups.
<h2>Yahtzee Rules</h2>
The rules are very variable and many variants exist in the establishment of the score sheet and in the counting of the points. However, the logic of probability must be respected (for example, a small sequence can not be 5 dice since the large suite also consists of 5 dice). Players are advised to agree at the beginning of the game. The explanations below are an example of a common game.
<h2>How to play Yahtzee</h2>
Each player rolls the dice when his turn comes. His goal is, using the five dice, to make a figure (5 identical dice, a pair, a triplet ...). To realize this figure, he has the right to three rolls of dice per turn and it is with each free throw to restart them all or just those of his choice.

The winner is the one who made the most points, some figures giving extra points if they are successful.

The score sheet is usually divided into two parts. However, some versions accept a third part, the one called <i>middle part</i> .

<h3>Yam's Box 1985</h3>
<i>Minor part</i>
<ul>
 	<li>Maximum of 1: players must get the highest number of dice with the face 1 / they mark 1 times the number of dice of value 1</li>
 	<li>Maximum of 2: the players must get the highest number of dice with the face 2 / they mark 2 times the number of dice of value 2</li>
 	<li>Maximum 3: players must get the highest number of dice with the face 3 / they mark 3 times the number of dice of value 3</li>
 	<li>Maximum of 4: the players must get the highest number of dice with the face 4 / they mark 4 times the number of dice of value 4</li>
 	<li>Maximum 5: Players must get the highest number of dice with the face 5 / Mark 5 times the number of dice of value 5</li>
 	<li>Maximum of 6: players must get the highest number of dice with the face 6 / they mark 6 times the number of dice of value 6</li>
</ul>
They get a 35 point bonus if the minor total is greater than 63 points.

<i>Major part</i>
<ul>
 	<li>Three of a kind: players must obtain 3 dice of the same value / they mark 3 times the value of identical dice</li>
 	<li>Square: players must obtain 4 dice of the same value / they mark 4 times the value of identical dice</li>
 	<li>Full: players must obtain 3 dice of the same value and 2 dice of the same value - (three of a kind + pair) / they score 25 points</li>
 	<li>Small Suite: players must get 4 dice that follow each other (1-2-3-4 / 2-3-4-5 / 3-4-5-6) / they score 30 points</li>
 	<li>Great Suite: Players must score 5 consecutive dice (1-2-3-4-5 / 2-3-4-5-6) / score 40 points</li>
 	<li>Yams: players must get 5 dice of the same value / they score 50 points (only 2 Yams are allowed)</li>
 	<li>Chance: players must obtain the highest number of points / they mark the sum of the value of the dice</li>
</ul>
Depending on the total (including bonus) of the minor part and the major part, the winner is designated.
<h3>Differences Yahtzee and Yam's Public domain</h3>
It is on this last part that the many versions of the Yahtzee differ. The counting of the points at Yam's knows several possible variations:
<ul>
 	<li>A full will always give you 25 points to the Yahtzee, while the Yam's total is 25 points + the sum of the dice. For example, a full 4 4 4 5 5 will give a total of 47 points (25 + 22)</li>
 	<li>The square is not worth much in the Yahtzee, in fact it is the total of the dice, for example with 6 6 6 6 1 this will give you 25. At Yam's this gives you 40 dots + dice so 40 + 25 = 65 points</li>
 	<li>An Yahtzee or a Yam's (5 identical dice) is worth 50 points to the Yahtzee, and 50 + dice to the Yam's thus from 55 to 80 points. This is "more equitable" because if a Yahtzee of 6 is done in the Yahtzee, it is as much as a Yahtzee of 1 (it should be noted, however, that the probability of obtaining five identical faces is the same regardless of the value of the face)</li>
 	<li>In a real box of Yam's in 1985 Game box / Yams</li>
 	<li>1-6 For each number, you must have a maximum of dice. If you get at least 63 points in the column, you have a bonus of 35. Example: Sum of the dice "3 3 3 2 4" For 3: 3 * 3 = 9, For 2: 2, For 4: 4.</li>
 	<li>Min (: strictly less than Max sum of 5 dice "3 2 3 2 4" 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 14</li>
 	<li>Max (or More): strictly greater than Min sum of 5 dice "3 5 6 3 4" 6 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 4 = 25</li>
 	<li>Three sets of identical dice 10 + sum of 3 dice 5 5 5 3 2 10 + 5 * 3 = 25</li>
 	<li>Square: 4 identical dice 30 + sum of 4 dice 3 3 3 3 6 30 + 3 * 4 = 42</li>
 	<li>Full: 3 identical dice + 2 identical dice 30 + sum of 5 dice 3 3 3 6 6 30+ (3 * 3) + (6 * 2) = 51</li>
 	<li>Continuation: 5 dice 30 + 5 sum dice 2 3 5 4 6 30 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 50</li>
 	<li>Yams: 5 identical dice 50 + sum of 5 dice 6 6 6 6 6 50 + 6 * 5 = 80</li>
</ul>
